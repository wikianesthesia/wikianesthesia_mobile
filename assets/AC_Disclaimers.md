## Medical Information
This tool is for informational and educational purposes only. The information provided may not be complete, accurate, or up-to-date.  Institutional protocols may differ and adopt approaches tailored to their patient populations and clinical judgment. Individual patient factors affecting bleeding risk—such as renal function, comorbidities, and concurrent medication use—should always be carefully considered. The timing and management guidance apply to each anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent individually; patients receiving multiple agents simultaneously carry an increased risk of bleeding complications. The content of this app is intended to support clinical decision-making and should be used alongside institutional policies and individualized patient assessment. As with all clinical decision support tools, ultimately use clinical judgement.
