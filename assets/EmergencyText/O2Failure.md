# Crisis Resources
* Inform Team
* Consider pausing procedure
* Call for help
* Get code cart w/ O2 Cylinder

# Non-Machine Ventilation
* Disconnect patient from machine and ventilate with **self-inflating bag (Ambu) on room air**
* **Do NOT connect self-inflating bag (Ambu) to machine auxiliary oxygen** because it has the same faulty O2 source
* Consider assigning capable person to manual ventilation

# Pulse Check
* **If no pulse**: start CPR and [Asystole/PEA](ACLS-AsystolePEA)

# Non-Machine O2 Source
* Attach self-inflating bag (Ambu) to:
    * Nozzle on transprot O2 E-cylinder **OR**
    * Nothing (continue ventilating on room air)

# Attach Gas sampling Line
* **Connect gas sampling line** with elbow connector between patient and self-inflating bag (Ambu)
* Verify correct airway placement with EtCO2
* Verify patient is receiving expected O2 concentration on gas analyzer: 100% if on E-Cylinder, 21% if on room air

# Low Pressure
* Confirm orogastric/NG Tube not in trachea

# Non-Machine Anesthetic
* **Maintain anesthesia w/ IV medications**
* Turn off volatile anesthetic

# Conserve O2
* Use lowest possible fresh gas flow and FiO2

# Report Problem
* Inform Charge Nurse, Anesthesia Coordinator, and all ORs
* Contact Bio-engineering to report problem and ask for help
* Find out if issue is system wide

# Team Recap
* Discuss plan for this patient and OR schedule
