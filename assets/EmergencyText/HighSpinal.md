# Diagnosis
* After neuralaxial anesthesia or analgesia
* Upper extremity numbness or weakness (hand grip)
* Dyspnea or Apnea
* Nausea or Vomiting
* Difficulty Swallowing
* Cardiovascular collapse: bradycardia and/or hypotension
* Loss of consciousness

# Crisis Resources
* Inform team
* Identify leader
* Call a code
* Get code cart

# Pulse check
* **If no pulses: start CPR and see** [Asystole/PEA](ACLS-AsystolePEA) or [VFib/VTach](ACLS-VFVT)

# Airway
* **100% O2 10-15 LPM**
* Support oxygenation and ventilation; intubate if necessary as respiratory compromise may last several hours. Patient might be conscious and need reassurance and an amnestic agent (e.g. Midaz) to prevent awareness

# Circulation
* If severe bradycardia or hypotension: **epinephrine** 10-100 mcg IV, increase as needed
* If mild bradycardia: consider **atropine** 0.5-1 mg or **glycopyrrolate** 0.2-0.4 mg, but progress quickly to epinephrine if needed. Phenylephrine unlikely to be effective

# Rapid Preload
* Give **rapid IV bolus** with pressure bag. May require several liters
* Raise both legs to increase preload
* Maintain neutral position. Head down position increases venous return but increases already high spinal level

# Pregnancy specific Care
* Ensure left uterine displacement
* Call OB/Neonatology teams
* Prepare for emergent or perimortem C-Section
* Monitor fetal heart tones

# Rule out LAST
* If local anesthetic toxicity is possible: give lipid emulsion 20% rapidly and go to [Local Anesthetic Toxicity](LAST)
