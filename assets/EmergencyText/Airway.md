# Crisis Resources 
* Inform team 
* Call for airway help 
* Call for difficult airway cart 
* Call for anesthesia tech 

# Optimize Conditions 
* Ensure paralysis (e.g. rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg)
* Ensure anesthetic depth (e.g. re-bolus or infuse propofol) 
* Optimize positioning (e.g. sniffing position, head of bed elevation to 30Â°,
neck extension, bed height)

# If Can Oxygenate 
* Do not fixate on intubation 
* Choose experienced operator and familiar equipment
* Monitor CO2 return by capnography and SpO2
* **If SpO2 critically low at any time: go to CANNOT INTUBATE/CANNOT OXYGENATE below**
* Consider oxygenation modalities (max 2 attempts each):
    * Consider awaken patient
    * **Mask:** use two-handed grip; insert oral/nasal airway 
    * **Supraglottic airway SGA/LMA:** optimize size and fit (change position of head or device, cuff inflation); consider 2nd generation
    * **Laryngoscopy:** video preferred. Consider alternate blade, rigid stylet, bougie, external laryngeal manipulation, release of cricoid pressure 
    * **Combined video/fiberoptic** intubation
    * Intubate through LMA
    * Consider other advanced airway techniques

# CANNOT INTUBATE/CANNOT OXYGENATE
* Call for Cric-capable help
* Get Cric Kit: Scalpel (10 Blade), Bougie, 6.0 ETT
* Additional operator can attempt to oxygenate from above (mask, LMA, VL)
* **Attempt cric/eFONA** (below)

# Cric/eFONA
* **Inform Team**: Announce emergency cric/get front of neck access
* **Call for help**: ENT, Gen Surg, ICU, Anesthesia, DART Team, Code Team
* **Prep**: Expose and **extend** neck. Obtain **scalpel, boujie, and lubricated 6.0 ET tube**
* **Meds**: Give **paralytic** and anesthetic 
* **Oxygenate and Monitor**: Additional operator can attempt to oxygenate from above (e.g. mask, SGA/LMA, video laryngoscopy). Monitor vital signs and pulse

# Contingency Plans for Known Difficult Airway
* Advanced airway equipment in room (e.g. difficult airway cart, second generation SGA/LMA, intubating SGA/LMA, intubation catheter, fiberoptic bronchoscope, rigid bronchoscope, scalpel/bougie cric kit) 
* Awake intubation 
* High flow apneic oxygenation
* Video laryngoscopy as first attempt 
* ENT or General Surgery in room 
* Awake tracheostomy (in consultation with surgeon)
* ECMO pre-cannulation with perfusionist in room
