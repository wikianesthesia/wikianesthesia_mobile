# Diagnosis
* Sudden decrease in EtCO2, BP, or SpO2
* Sudden increase in CVP
* Dyspnea, respiratory distress, or cough in awake patient
* Increased risk in long bone ortho surgery, pregnancy, cancer (especially renal), high BMI, laproscopic, or surgical site above level of heart

# Crisis Resources
* Inform Team
* Call for Help
* Identify Leader
* Get Code Cart
* Consider terminating procedure

# Pulse Check
* **If no pulse:** start CPR, check rhythm, and follow appropriate algorithm [Asystole/PEA](ACLS-AsystolePEA) or [VFib/VTach](ACLS-VFVT)

# Airway
* **100% O2 10-15 LPM**

# Circulation
* **Turn off volatile anesthetic and vasodilating drips**
* Give IV vasopressor bolus to support circulation
* Consider rapid fluid bolus if **not in right heart failure**

# Evaluate Right Heart
* If unstable or RV function decreased on TEE/TTE, use medication and diuresis to:
    * Maintain sinus rhythm
    * Maintain normal RV volume status
    * Maintain RV contractility
    * Decrease RV Afterload
* Go to [Right Heart Failure](RightHeartFailure)

# ECMO/CBP
* If severe decompensation: consider ECMO or cardiopulmonary bypass

# Rule Out
Consider other causes:
* [Anaphylaxis](Anaphylaxis)
* Bone cement implantation syndrome
* Bronchospasm
* Cardiac Tamponade
* Cardiogenic Shock
* Distributive Shock
* Hypovolemia
* [Myocardial Ischemia](MI)
* [Pneumothorax](PTX)
* Pulmonary Edema

# Pulmonary thromboembolism
* Discuss feasibility of urgent thrombolysis or thrombectomy with surgical team
* Thrombolysis: If safe, use recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) alteplase 10 mg IV followed by infusion of 90 mg over 2 hrs
* Thrombectomy: Consider STAT Cardiovascular Surgery consult (open) vs STAT IR Consult (percutaneous)
* Supportive treatment: Airway, Breathing, Circulation

# Venous Air/CO2 Embolus
* **Limit entrainment of air**: check IV lines for air; flood surgical fields with saline; consider placing surgical site below heart; consider left lateral decubitus position
* **Atempt removal of air**: Aspirate air from central line if present
* Supportive treatment: airway, breathing, circulation
* Consider hyperbaric oxygen treatment

# Cement/Fat Embolism
* Suspect if **Petechial rash**
* Supportive Treatment

# Amniotic fluid embolism
* Supportive Treatment
* Monitor fetus and consider urgent C-Section
* Monitor for and treat seizures and DIC
