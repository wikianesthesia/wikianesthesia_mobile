# Crisis Resources
* Inform Team
* Consider pausing
* Call for help
* Consider calling for code cart

# Oxygenate
* 100% O2 10-15 LPM

# Check monitors and vitals
* Check gas analyzer to rule out FiO2 or High N2O. Consider [Oxygen Failure](O2Failure)
* Check EtCO2 waveform, look for **circuit disconnection**
* Check vitals: EKG, Cycle NIBP, check pulse, airway pressure
* Check SpO2 waveform, probe positioning, limb perfusion

# Initial ETT check
* APL Valve 20-30 cm H2O, **manually ventilate** to check compliance
* Consider using self-inflating ambu bag with non-machine O2 source (e.g. e-cylinder) or nothing (room air) to **rule out machine or oxygen supply issue**. Connect smaple line and consider IV anesthetic
* Check ETT position and **auscultate breath sounds**. Consider [Bronchospasm](Bronchospasm)
* Soft suction ETT to assess secretions and paetncy

# Recruit alveoli
* Perform **recruitment breaths**
* Consider PEEP. If hypotensive, use caution
* Increase FRC: **head up position, desufflate abdomen**

# Meds
* If BP stable: deepen anesthetic with propofol or volatile
* If wheezing: **albuterol** 4-8 MDI or 2.5 mg Nebulized. If severe: **epinephrine** 5-10 mcg IV, **ketamine** 10-20 mg IV
* Consider additional neuromuscular blockade or reversal

# Advanced Evaluation
* Consider fiberoptic **bronchoscopy**: confirm tracheal rings, check for endobronchial intubation or obstruction
* **Lung Ultrasound**: check for [Pneumothorax](PTX), Effusion Consolidation, Interstitial Edema

# Access
* Consider Arterial Line placement and ABG

# X-Ray
* Consider STAT portable Chest X-ray

# ECMO/CPB
* If persistent: consider ECMO or bypass

# Differential
* Go to [differential](HypoxiaDDx) if still not resolved
