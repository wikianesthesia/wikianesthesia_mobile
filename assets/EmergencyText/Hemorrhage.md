# Crisis resources
* Inform team
* Identify leader
* Call for anesthesiology, surgery, and nursing help
* Consider activate **Massive Transfusion Protocal (MTP)**

# Early Response
* Give **IV Fluid**  bolus (e.g. crystalloid, colloid). If significant hemorrahge: **prioritize transfusion** of blood products
* Establish large bore IV access: consider IO or Cordis
* Temporize severe hypotension with **vasopressor** bolus
* Consider **head down** position or leg elevation

# Airway
* **100% O2 10-15 LPM**
* Consider intubation prior to airway swelling

# Critical Response
* If severe hemodynamic instability at any point:
    * Inform surgeon and **suggest surgical temporizing measures** (e.g. packing, major vessel compression or crossclamp, hemostatic agents: thrombin or fibrin glue)
    * **Get additional surgical help** (e.g. Trauma, Vascular, Cardiac, Gyn-Onc, or Gen Surg)

# Rapid Infuser and Cell Saver
* Delegate setup of rapid infusion system
* Cell saver (if surgical site is not contaminated or cancerous)

# Transfuse
* If significant bleeding: transfuse, do not wait for lab results
* Check all blood
* Based on clinical picture: transfuse **1-2 pRBC: 1 FFP: 1 Platelet Pack**
* Adjust empiric transfusion for any clinical or laboratory signs of coagulopathy

# Normothermia
* Warm room, use warm fluids, forced air, and blankets

# Arterial Line
* Consider arterial line placement for monitoring and serial lab draws

# Urine Output
* Place foley. Urine output goal > 0.5 cc/kg/hr

# Labs
* Monitor resucitation adequacy with clinical stability and serial labs: Hgb, platelets, coagulation, acid base status, base deficit, electrolytes, lactate, TEG/Rotem
* Actively **maintain normal calcium** level

# Blood Products/Therapeutic Adjuncts
* **pRBC**: Give if Hgb < 7-10 depending on hemodynamic stability. Each unit should raise Hgb ~1g/dL
* **FFP**: Give if INR > 1.5x normal or R time prolonged. Give 10-15 cc/kg at a time
* **Platelets**: Give if platelets < 50-100 K/uL or MA decreased. Each unit should raise platelet count by 50
* **Cryoprecipitate**: Give if fibrinogen <80-100 (<300 peripartum) or alpha angle decreased. Each 10 units of cryo should raise fibrinogen by 50
* **Fibrinogen Concentrate**: If cryo unavailable, consider fibrinogen concentrate 0.5-1 g IV. Each gram should raise by 50
* **TXA**: Consider TXA in all major bleeding cases. Give 1g IV over 10 mins then 1 g IV over 8 hrs
* **Prothrombin Complex Concentrate**: Consider PCC in patients with warfarin-induced bleeding or persistent deranged INR. Give 25-50 units/kg IV (might require heme consult)
* **Factor VIIa Concentrate**: Consider if life-threatening, refractory coagulopathy. Consult heme
