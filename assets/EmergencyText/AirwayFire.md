# Crisis Resources
* Inform team
* Identify leader
* Call an anesthesia stat
* Assign team member to read cognitive aid out loud

# Anesthesia Professional Immediate Response
* **Disconnect breathing circuit** from the anesthesia machine to prevent torch formation
* **Stop fresh gas flow**

# Surgeon Immediate Response
* Prevent torch formation if circuit not yet disconnected
* **If clamp immediately available: clamp ET tube.**
* **If clamp not available: fold (kink) ET tube** 
* **Immediately remove ET tube** and any airway foreign bodies
* **Pour saline into airway** and suction debris

# Check Extent of Fire
* If fire spreads beyond airway (e.g. to drapes, patient) and go to [Nonairway Fire](Fire)

# After Fire Extinguished
* **Re-establish oxygenation** when fire is extinguished
* Minimize FiO2 as much as possible. Consider air ventilation.
* **Consider prompt reintubation** with ET tube â‰¥ 7.0 mm ID prior to swelling
* Ensure adequate anesthesia: e.g. propofol infusion
* Perform bronchoscopy examination of entire airway to assess injury and remove residual debris
* Inspect ET tube pieces to verify none left in airway
* Save all materials for later investigation
* Consider steroid: e.g. dexamethasone 8 mg IV

# Dispo
* ICU care for prolonged mechanical ventilation and airway observation

# Prevention for All High Risk Procedures
* **Fire Risk = Fuel Source + Oxidizer + Ignition Source**
* Discuss fire prevention and response during time out
* Avoid FiO2 >0.3 and avoid N2O
* Anesthesia provider: communicate FiO2 changes
* Surgeon: communicate use of laser or electrocautery

# Prevention for Laser Surgery of Vocal Cord or Larynx
* Use laser resistant ET tube (single or double cuff)
* Ensure ET tube cuff is sufficiently below vocal cords
* Consider filling proximal ET tube cuff with methylene blue-tinted saline
* Surgeon: keep laser in standby when not in use
* Surgeon: check FiO2 < 0.3 and N2O not in use before lasering or electrocauterizing
* Anesthesia provider: communicate FiO2 changes

# Prevention for Non-laser Surgery in Oropharynx
* Regular PVC ET tube may be used
* Surgeon: protect ET tube with wet gauze
* Consider continuous suctioning inside oropharynx
* Surgeon: confirm FiO2, < 0.3 and no N2O prior to electrocautery use
* Anesthesia provider: communicate FiO2 changes
