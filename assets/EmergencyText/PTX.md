# Diagnosis
* Increased peak inspiratory pressures (PIP)
* Tachycardia
* Hypotension or Hypoxemia
* Decreased or asymmetric breath sounds
* Hyperresonance to chest percussion
* Tracheal deviation (late sign)
* Increased JVD/CVP
* Decompensation upon initiation of mechanical ventilation or central line placement
* Higher incidence in trauma, COPD, cardiothoracic, or upper abdominal surgery patients

# Crisis Resources
* Inform Team
* Call for help
* Identify Leader
* Get code cart
* Call Trauma, General, or CT Surgery STAT

# Airway
* **100% O2 10-15 LPM**

# Fast Checks/Differential
* Exclude Endobronchial Intubation: listen to breath sounds and check ETT depth
* Exclude ETT obstruction: pass soft suction catheter
* Exclude auto-PEEP: briefly disconnect breathing circuit

# Decompress Emergently
* If unstable and chest tube is not immediately available:
    * Place 14/16G IV Catheter in 4th or 5th Intercostal Space between atnerior and mid-axillary line per ATLS 2018 (may hear a whoosh of air if under tension)
    * Leave IV catheter in place while awaiting chest tube
* **Have appropriate personal place chest tube**

# Advanced Checks
* Fiberoptic bronchoscopy to evaluate for endobronchial intubation, ET Tube obstruction
* Lung ultrasound: Luing sliding (normal) vs lung point (pneumothorax). Seashore sign (normal) vs barcode (pneumothorax)
* Consider STAT portable chest x-ray; **do not delay treatment**

# Dispo
* Consider ICU care for respiratory monitoring and chest tube management
