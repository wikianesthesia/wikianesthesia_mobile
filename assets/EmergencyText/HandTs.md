# Heart Rate/Vagal Stimulus
* Desufflate abdomen
* Retract surgical retractors and sponges
* Remove pressure from eyes, neck, ears, and brain. Drain bladder

# Hypovolemia
* Give rapid IV fluid bolus
* Check Hgb
* Consider anemia or [Hemorrohage](Hemorrhage)
* Consider relative hypovolemia:
    * Auto-PEEP: Disconnect Circuit
    * IVC Compression
    * Obstructive or distributive shock
    * [Anaphylaxis](Anaphylaxis)
    * [High Spinal](HighSpinal)

# Hypoxemia
* O2 100% 10-15 LPM
* Check breathing circuit connections
* Confirm ETT placement with CO2 and breath sounds
* Suction ETT
* Consider CXR, Bronchoscopy
* See [Hypoxemia](Hypoxemia)

# Hydrogen - Acidosis
* Consider bicarb

# Tension Pneumothorax
* Check for asymmetric breath sounds, distended neck veins, deviated trachea
* Consider ultrasound for normal lung sliding, abnormal lung point
* Consider CXR, but do NOT delay treatment
* Perform empiric needle decompression in 4th/5th intercostal space anterior to the mid-axillary line, then chest tube
* See [Pneumothorax](PTX)

# Thrombosis-Coronary
