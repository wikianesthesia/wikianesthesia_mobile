# Crisis Resources
* Inform team
* Activate fire alarm and call code red
* Call an anesthesia stat
* Get CO2 fire extinguisher
* Assign team member to read cognitive aid out loud

# Prevent Airway Fire
* **Stop fresh gas flow**
* **Disconnect breathing circuit** from the anesthesia machine to stop all airway gas flow
* Ventilate with portable self-inflating bag (Ambu) on room air

# Prevent Patient Harm
* **Remove all burning and flammable materials** (e.g. drapes, fabrics) from patient and onto floor; extinguish and flames

# Extinguish Flames (PASS)
* If **non-electrical** fire: use CO2 fire extinguisher (safe for wound) and saline or water (e.g. from basin, bottles, IV bags)
* If **electrical** fire: use only CO2 fire extinguisher
* PULL: Pull the pin
* AIM: Aim for the base of the fire
* SQUEEZE: Squeeze the trigger in five second bursts
* SWEEP: Sweep from side-to-side to put out the fire

# Care for Patient
* Assess for injuries; monitor vital signs
* Ensure adequate anesthesia e.g. propofol infusion

# Consider Evacuation
* If continued smoke or fire: evacuate patient and staff
* If no smoke or fire: stay and shelter in place

# Contain Fire
* Close operating room doors
* Turn off external gas supply valves for O2 and N2O

# Check Extent of Fire
* If fire spreads to airway: go to [Airway Fire](AirwayFire)

# Team Recap
* Discuss with surgeon and OR leadership the implications of fire for this patient and OR schedule

# Prevention For All High Risk Procedures
* **Fire Risk = Fuel Source + Oxidizer + Ignition Source**
* Discuss fire prevention and response during time out
* Avoid FiO2 >0.3 and avoid N2O
* Communicate FiO2 changes and electrocautery or laser use throughout case

# Prevention For Highest Risk: MAC Head and Neck Procedures
* Use minimum O2 concentration for adequate SpO2
* Use nasal cannula instead of face mask if able
* If high O2 concentration required: use LMA or ET tube
* Configure drapes to avoid O2 build up, consider active scavenging if required
* Allow complete drying of alcohol skin prep solutions
