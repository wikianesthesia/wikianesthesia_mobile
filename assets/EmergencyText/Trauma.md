# Crisis Resources
* Initiate trauma team
* Activate trauma operating room
* Activate massive transfusion protocol (MTP)

# On Arrival to Trauma Bay
* All team members state name and role. Use clear, closed-loop communication. Record events.
* Check pulse. **If no pulse: start [ACLS](ACLS-AsystolePEA) while transfusing and performing primary survey to find and treat cause**
* Place standard monitors and obtain large-bore IV access
* Maintain **c-spine precautions** with all movement

# Primary Survey
* **Airway and Breathing:**
    * Evaluate airway, ensure oxygenation and ventilation
* Intubate if indicated. Recommend RSI with video laryngoscopy, in-line stabilization, and capnography. **If hypotensive, modify or eliminate induction medication.** If indicated, surgical airway.
    * Treat pneumo or hemothorax with emergent chest tubes
* **Circulation:**
    * Control external hemorrhage. Transfusion preferred over crystalloid bolus.
    * Perform **FAST:** Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma
* **Disability:**
    * Assess level of consciousness, pupils, glucose, and Glasgow Coma Scale
* **Exposure:**
    * Fully expose to assess injury then cover to prevent hypothermia

# Secondary Survey
* **AMPLE History:** Allergies, Medications, Past medical history, Last meal, Events leading to injury
* **AT MIST:** Age, Time of injury, Mechanism of injury, Injuries sustained, Systemic review, Treatments
* Head-to-toe physical exam and radiologic evaluation

# Trauma OR Setup (Prepare in advance and check before patient arrival)
* **Warm OR** to >25C (77F) to maintain normothermia
* **Setup:** machine, suction, monitors, airway (video laryngoscope or fibertopic, and surgical airway), IV and IO kits, rapid infusion device, ultrasound machine, code cart, invasive monitoring equipment (e.g. arterial line, CVP), cell saver
* **Medications:** e.g. midazolam, ketamine, propofol, etomidate, succinylcholine, rocuronium, epinephrine, vasopressin, ephedrine, phenylephrine, calcium, antibiotics
* **Check:** crystalloid, colloid, and **blood products (MTP)**

# Induction and Airway
* Place standard ASA monitors and preoxygenate
* If patient conscious, briefly reassure them
* Discuss among team (e.g. Anesthesiology, Surgery, Nursing, others) timing and order of priorities including IV and arterial access, inducing anesthesia, securing airway, hemorrhage resuscitation, and incision
* Perform RSI with C-spine precautions
* Place additional IVs and arterial line
* If stable: anesthetic maintenance with volatile anesthetic
* If unstable: anesthetic maintenance with benzodiazepine or ketamine infusion

# Temporize
* **If severe instability inform surgeon.** Discuss temporizing measures (e.g. packing, aortic compression or crossclamp, thrombin, fibrin glue, REBOA (resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta)

# Transfuse
* Based on clinical picture: transfuse with ratio of **1-2 PRBC : 1 FFP : 1 Platelet pack**
* Administer calcium with ongoing transfusion (1g/10 mL 10% calcium chloride or 1g/50 mL NS calcium gluconate)
* Coagulopathy may require cryo, fibrinogen, calcium, and/or TXA based on TEG

# Traumatic Brain Injury
* **Maintain CPP while decreasing ICP**
    * MAP ≥ 80, SBP ≥ 100 mmHg
    * SpO2 ≥ 90%, EtCO2 35-40 mmHg
    * Mannitol or hypertonic saline
    * Head up position
    * Burst suppression

# Labs
* Crossmatch, serial ABGs, Hgb, lytes, lactate, coags (platelets, fibrinogen, TEG)

# Medications
* **If < 3 hours since injury, give tranexamic acid (TXA):**
    * 1g IV over 10 min, then 1g every 8 hours
* Give calcium for coagulation and blood pressure
* Treat hyperkalemia
    * Calcium chloride 1g IV
    * Sodium bicarbonate 1 amp IV (50 mEq)
    * Regular insulin 5-10 units IV with dextrose/D50 1 amp IV (25 g)

# Post event
* ICU care for continued resuscitation
