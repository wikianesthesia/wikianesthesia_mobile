# Crisis Resources
* Inform team

# Stop Meds
* **Confirm all volatile and IV anesthetics are off**

# Vital Signs
* Check for and correct any hypoxemia, hypercarbia, hypothermia, or hypotension
* Check for signs of high ICP: widened pulse pressure (increased systolic, decreased diastolic), bradycardia, irregular respirations

# Paralysis
* Check for and **reverse** residual neuromuscular paralysis with sugammadex or neostigmine with glycopyrrolate

# Neuro Exam
* Perform neurological exam
* Check for pupil changes, motor asymmetry, and gag
* **If abnormal or suspect stroke:** Call Stroke Code or equivalent, obtain STAT head CT and/or STAT Neurology/Neurosurgery consult

# Med Reversal
* Consider opioid reversal: **naloxone** 40 mcg IV; may double dose and repeat every 2 minutes up to 400 mcg
* Consider benzodiazepine reversal: **flumazenil** 0.2 mg IV every 1 minute; max dose 1 mg
* Consider anticholinergic syndrome (e.g. scopolamine): **physostigmine 1mg IV with atropine available** for cholinergic crisis with severe bradycardia
* Re-treat because reversal agents have short half lives

# Sugar
* Check for and correct hypoglycemia

# Labs
* Send ABG plus electrolytes to evaluate for hypercarbia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, and hypercalcemia

# Medication 
* Check for possible medication error
* Consider delayed med clearance (hepatic, renal)

# Rare Causes
* Consider high spinal, serotonin syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, myxedema coma, seizure, thyroid storm, and hepatic/uremic encephalopathy

# Follow-up
* If residual mental status abnormalities, monitor patient in ICU with neurologic follow up
