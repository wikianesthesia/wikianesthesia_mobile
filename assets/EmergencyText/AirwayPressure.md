# Crisis Resources
* Inform team
* Identify leader
* Call for help

# Airway
* **100% O2 10-15 L/min**
* Confirm presence of CO2
* Evaluate capnography waveform:
* Upward slope suggests obstruction
* Curare cleft near end of expiratory phase suggests insufficiency neuromuscular blockade
* Starting at patient: inspect breathing circuit including valves, connections, and sample line

# Rule Out Air Trapping
* Disconnect breathing circuit from ETT or SGA/LMA to **rule out air trapping** (i.e. auto-PEEP)

# Localize Problem
* **During disconnect, squeeze reservoir bag.** If pressure is:
    * **High** (machine or circuit is obstructed): **Switch to self-inflating bag (Ambu)** connected to O2 source and gas sampling line
    * **Low or zero** (problem is with ETT or lungs) **Reconnect anesthesia circuit**

# Optimize Compliance
* Consider increasing anesthetic: e.g. **propofol** 20mg IV
* Consider additional neuromuscular blockade
* If abdominal insufflation: decrease or release pressure
* Evaluate patient position. If head down: consider level or head-up positioning. If prone: consider turning supine
* If surgical retraction contributing: notify surgeon
* Check for shift in patient position (e.g. slipping off prone position supports)

# Manually Ventilate
* Manually ventilate using anesthesia machine to assess compliance
* Check and adjust adjustable pressure limiting valve (APL)

# Check for ETT Obstruction
* Pass a soft suction catheter to rule out kinked ET tube or thick secretions (mucus plug)
* Consider bronchoscopy to evaluate ET tube and airway
* If unable to clear ET tube obstruction: replace ET tube

# Auscultate Breath Sounds
* If asymmetric: rule out endobronchial intubation or pneumothorax
* If symmetric but abnormal breath sounds: if wheezing or decreased breath sounds, consider bronchospasm treatment. If crackles, consider pulmonary edema treatment

# Potential Causes: ET tube or lungs
* Abdominal compartment syndrome
* Abdominal insufflation
* Airway foreign body
* Airway tumor
* Anaphylaxis
* Aspiration
* Bronchospasm
* Chest wall rigidity
* Kinked ET tube or circuit
* Laryngospasm
* Light anesthesia
* Mucus plug
* Muscle tone
* Patient positioning
* Pleural effusion
* Pneumothorax/hemothorax
* Pulmonary edema
* Thoracic insufflation

# Potential Causes: Machine or breathing circuit
* Circuit obstruction
* Scavenger closed
* Ventilator valve malfunction
